JSON Schema âž£ DDL
---

We use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) pretty extensively at [Better](https://better.com) to store complex data. Unfortunately the data is hard to query from SQL. To facilitate querying, this library converts objects stored in a JSON schema into flat Postgres tables with proper types.

For instance, Better uses it to generate 50+ tables automatically, with millions of rows, from a very complex JSON schema that is 7000+ lines long.

Postgres and Redshift are supported, although the latter is somewhat experimental still.

Installation

The easiest way to install is `pip install jsonschema2db`
